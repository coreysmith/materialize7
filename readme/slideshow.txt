Slideshow for Materialize7

You can download the slideshow feature we use for slideshow presentations. 

To install, you'll need to make sure that you have views, features, and flexslider for this to work.

The view will create a block for a slideshow presentation. We put that block in the preface region of the home page.

To create a slideshow slide, you'll need to create a node for each slide using the slideshow presentation content type. It's intentionally made simple to support the concept of hero banners. It is recommended that each node used to create a slideshow has the same content but a different image so only the background changes.
